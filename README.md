# Dry-Wet-Robo-Sorter-for-Automated-Waste-Management

Effective waste management has become increasingly crucial on university campuses, where large volumes of waste are generated daily. Traditional methods of manual waste sorting are labor- intensive, time-consuming, and often result in improper segregation, reducing the effectiveness of recycling programs. To address these issues, our project introduces an RC rover with an automated waste separation system, designed specifically for university environments. This prototype aims to promote sustainable practices by integrating technology into campus waste management. By efficiently identifying and sorting wet and dry waste, it contributes to a cleaner campus while educating students on environmental responsibility and innovation.

Problems:

1. Inefficient Sorting: Manual segregation leads to mixed waste and poor recycling.
2. High Labor Costs: Requires significant manpower for sorting and collection.
3. Contamination: Mixing of wet and dry waste reduces recyclability.
4. Time-Intensive: Manual processes are slow, causing bin overflow.
5. Low Awareness: Lack of automation limits knowledge of proper waste management.
6. Environmental Impact: Ineffective waste handling increases pollution and hinders sustainability goals.

PROPOSED SOLUTION:

1.Automated Waste Segregation: Design and implement a system that uses sensors to automatically distinguish between wet and dry waste, ensuring precise segregation at the source. This minimizes contamination, making recycling more efficient and reducing landfill contributions.

2.Remote Mobility for
Efficient Collection: Equip the system with a remote- controlled rover to reach various campus areas, including hard-to- access and high-traffic zones. This mobility enhances the flexibility of waste collection, ensuring that waste segregation is consistent across all campus locations.
